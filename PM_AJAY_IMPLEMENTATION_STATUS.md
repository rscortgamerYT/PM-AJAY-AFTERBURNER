# PM-AJAY Multi-Level Request Management System - Implementation Status

## Overview
The PM-AJAY Multi-Level Request Management System has been successfully implemented with comprehensive backend infrastructure, data models, and repository layers. The system connects Centre, State, Agencies, and Public through structured approval chains with proper notifications and document management.

## ✅ Completed Components

- **Notifications Table**: Real-time notification system
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Implemented security policies for all tables
- **Indexes**: Performance optimization indexes created

### 2. Data Models (`lib/models/requests/`)

#### Enums (`enums.dart`)
- `StateRequestType`: Fund allocation, scheme expansion, policy clarification, technical support
- `PriorityLevel`: High, medium, low with color coding
- `RequestStatus`: Submitted, under review, approved, rejected, revision required
- `SchemeComponent`: Adarsh Gram, Hostel, GIA
- `AgencyType`: Government, PSU, Private, NGO

#### Core Models

### 3. Repository Layer (`lib/repositories/`)

#### StateRequestRepository (`state_request_repository.dart`)
- ✅ Submit state requests to Centre
- ✅ Review state requests by Centre
- ✅ Real-time request streaming
- ✅ Notification integration
- ✅ CRUD operations

#### PublicRequestRepository (`public_request_repository.dart`)
- ✅ Submit public requests to State
- ✅ Review public requests by State
- ✅ Real-time request streaming
- ✅ Notification to citizens
- ✅ CRUD operations with filtering

#### AgencyRequestRepository (`agency_request_repository.dart`)
- ✅ Submit agency registration requests
- ✅ Review and approve agency requests
- ✅ Auto-create agency profiles on approval
- ✅ Real-time request streaming
- ✅ CRUD operations

### 4. Services (`lib/services/`)

#### NotificationService (`notification_service.dart`)
- ✅ Real-time notification streaming
- ✅ Mark notifications as read
- ✅ Unread count tracking
- ✅ Send notifications
- ✅ Bulk operations (mark all as read, delete all)

## 🔧 Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Flutter/Dart
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (for documents)

## 📝 Key Design Decisions

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Models, repositories, and services are clearly separated
2. **Real-time First**: All lists use Supabase streams for live updates
3. **Notification-Driven**: Every action triggers appropriate notifications
4. **Type Safety**: Strong typing with enums and models
5. **Scalability**: Repository pattern allows easy testing and modifications
